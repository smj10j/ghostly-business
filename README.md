Trying out casperjs
===================


1. Installation on OSX

  ```bash
  brew update
  brew install casperjs
  ```


2. Spent a few minutes modifying an example on the Github repository...

  ```bash
  echo "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/smj10j/ghostly-business/master/boo.js)" > boo.js
  casperjs test boo.js
  open *.png
  ```


3. I guess I don't have a step 3
