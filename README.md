Trying out casperjs
===================

[https://github.com/n1k0/casperjs#show-me-some-code](https://github.com/n1k0/casperjs#show-me-some-code)


1. Installation on OSX

  ```bash
  brew update
  brew install casperjs
  ```


2. Spent a few minutes modifying an example on the Github repository...

  ```bash
  echo "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/smj10j/ghostly-business/master/boo.js)" > boo.js
  casperjs test boo.js
  open *.png
  ```


3. I guess I don't have a step 3
  
  - T0 - decided to check out how Casperjs is
  - T5 - created a git repo and installed casperjs via brew while reading example at https://github.com/smj10j/ghostly-business
  - T10 - example is running locally
  - T25 - switched to test locale switcher on logged-out homepage of extrabux.com
  - T40 - added screenshot capture for failure and success cases
  - T60 - wrote this file
